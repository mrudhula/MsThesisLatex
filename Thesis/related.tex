Virtual fitting frameworks are complex systems composed of many modules. The related works on the major components of our framework are summarized in this chapter, 
along with the history of the general framework. 

The overall framework can be divided into three major modules: \textit{human body animation and motion smoothing} , \textit{motion capture systems and depth sensors} and 
\textit{physics engines, cloth simulation and collision detection}. An important offline part of the framework is the \textit{modeling humans and apparels}, which has evolved 
significantly over the last years.
